# Data Structures and Algorithms

## What is Algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem. It takes a set of input and produces a desired output.

## What is Data Structure?
Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

### Types
#### Linear Data Structures
Elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.

1. Array - Elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory. All the elements of an array are of the same type.
2. Stack  - In stack data structure, elements are stored in the LIFO principle.
3. Queue - The queue data structure works in the FIFO principle where first element stored in the queue will be removed first.
4. Linked List - Data elements are connected through a series of nodes. And, each node contains the data items and address to the next node.

#### Non-Linear Data Structure
Elements are arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements.
1. Graph - Each node is called vertex and each vertex is connected to other vertices through edges.
2. Tree - Similar to a graph, however, in tree data structure, there can only be one edge between two vertices.

## Difference b/w linear and non-linear
| Linear | Non-Linear |
|--|--|
| The data items are arranged in sequential order, one after the other. | The data items are arranged in non-sequential order (hierarchical manner). |
| All the items are present on the single layer. | The data items are present at different layers. |
| It can be traversed on a single run. That is, if we start from the first element, we can traverse all the elements sequentially in a single pass. | It requires multiple runs. That is, if we start from the first element it might not be possible to traverse all the elements in a single pass. |
| The memory utilization is not efficient. | Different structures utilize memory in different efficient ways depending on the need. |
| The time complexity increase with the data size. | Time complexity remains the same. |
