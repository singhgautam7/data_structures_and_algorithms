# Role Of Data Structure And Algorithms In Programming

Programming is all about data structures and algorithms. Data structures are used to hold data while algorithms are used to solve the problem using that data.

Here are few of the reasons to learn and implement DSA -
1. Scalability
2. Memory Saving
